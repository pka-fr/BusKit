## 💡 Motivation

If you've ever worked with Azure Service Bus on a Mac, you've probably felt it —
the gap left by the absence of a true macOS-native client.

[**Azure Service Bus Explorer**](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer)
is a fantastic tool, but it's Windows-only. Mac users are often left with workarounds:
running VMs, using the Azure Portal, or relying on cross-platform tools that feel
out of place on macOS.

**BusKit was born out of that frustration.**

The goal is simple: bring a first-class Azure Service Bus experience to macOS —
one that doesn't just *run* on a Mac, but *belongs* on a Mac. BusKit is built from
the ground up following **Apple's Human Interface Guidelines**, embracing native
macOS conventions, controls, and design patterns that macOS users expect and love.

No Electron. No ports. No compromises. Just a tool that feels right at home on your Mac. 🍎

## 🏗️ Architecture

BusKit is built on a **Sidecar pattern** — the backend and UI run as separate processes
communicating via **gRPC**:

- **Backend — C#/.NET** — a sidecar process leveraging the official
  [Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net) for all
  Azure Service Bus operations
- **UI — Swift/SwiftUI** — native macOS front-end that communicates with the
  sidecar via gRPC, following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

This architecture ensures a **clean separation of concerns** — the Swift layer
focuses purely on the macOS experience, while the C# sidecar handles all
Azure communication.
